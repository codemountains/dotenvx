This library is meant to be used on development or testing environments in
which setting environment variables is not practical. It loads environment
variables from a `.env` file, if available, and mashes those with the actual
environment variables provided by the operative system.

Usage
----

The easiest and most common usage consists on calling `dotenv::dotenv` when the
application starts, which will load environment variables from a file named
`.env` in the root directory; after that, you can just call the
environment-related method you need as provided by `std::os`.

If you need finer control about the name of the file or its location, you can
use the `from_filename` and `from_path` methods provided by the crate.

Examples
----

A `.env` file looks like this:

```sh
# a comment, will be ignored
REDIS_ADDRESS=localhost:6379
MEANING_OF_LIFE=42
```

You can optionally prefix each line with the word `export`, which will
conveniently allow you to source the whole file on your shell.

A sample project using Dotenv would look like this:

```rust
extern crate dotenv;

use dotenv::dotenv;
use std::os::env;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();

    for (key, value) in env().into_iter() {
        println!("key: {}, value: {}", key, value)
    }
}
```

Issues
----

* The way errors are implemented is not as nice as it could be. Now that
[FromError][fromerror] has landed, a better design for `DotenvError` and
`ParseError` is possible.
